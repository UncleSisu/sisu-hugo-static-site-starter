The Mushroom House (also known as the TreeHouse) is an ornately fanciful home built by architect Terry Brown in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio.[1][2] The one-bedroom house features pressed copper ceilings and a spiral staircase entry.[3]

It was built between 1992 and 2006 and served as the architect's secondary residence until his death in 2008. Standing on the busy corner of Erie and Tarpis Avenues, it is a prominent Cincinnati landmark and one of Cincinnati's best-known residences.
